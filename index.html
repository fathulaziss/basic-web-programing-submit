                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Azis, and I am a Flutter enthusiast. My interest in mobile application development began in
                    2020, when I learned about Flutter during my final year of university and decided to focus on it to start my career as mobile application developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to today, and I have gained experience from my first job as a mobile application developer at an information technology services and consulting company, and
                    I have decided to pursue new opportunities at PT. Austindo Nusantara Jaya Tbk, where my primary focus is now on developing mobile applications for tracking and recording farming results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I also continue to study about mobile application development, specifically Flutter, in order to stay current.
                </p>
